# Parkinson-Disease-Prediction
Developed a predictive model for early detection of Parkinson's disease by leveraging machine learning algorithms in Python. This project focused on identifying patterns in patient data, such as voice measurements, to detect early symptoms of Parkinson's. By cleaning, processing, and analyzing the dataset, I applied classification techniques, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Standard Scaler to predict disease presence with high accuracy. Model evaluation metrics, like “accuracy” guided improvements for optimal performance.
